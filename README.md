## Getting Started

### TensorFlow Guide
The following documents are issued by the Tensorflow Developemnt Ceritifcation website. They outline everything tested on the exam, how the exam is conducted, how to register, and how you can prepare.
- [TensorFlow Certificate Home](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate)
- [Environment Setup:](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/Setting_Up_TF_Developer_Certificate_Exam.pdf?authuser=4) Exam takes place in a PyCharm environment. 
- [Certificate Handbook](https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf) :star2:

### TensorFlow Intro
- [Ultimate Guide To TensorFlow 2.0](https://rubikscode.net/2019/04/22/ultimate-guide-to-tensorflow-2-0-in-python/): A good genric intro to TensorFlow 2.0 with an example on the Iris Dataset.
- [Effective TF2](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/effective_tf2): Google's detailed and indepth guide to all things TensorFlow 2.0. :bulb: 

### Blog Articles
Below is a list of blog articles that help get an idea what others did in terms of study for the exam.

[How I passed the certified tensorflow developer exam, Harshi Tyagi](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-passed-the-certified-tensorflow-developer-exam/) 
- Does a good job breaking down his study plan, and reviews each course he completed. Find his resource list [here](https://www.notion.so/15049893501f4387893a5de0059ef8a5?v=9154c52a61494668b12802f157bce0d4)

[How I passed the tensorflow developer certification exam, Daniel Bourke](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-passed-the-tensorflow-developer-certification-exam-f5672a1eb641) 
- Any blog article by Daniel Bourke is going to help you get motivated to learn and acheive. Somewhat of a rehash of the previous article, still a quality resource for learning about the exam. He also discusses what happens during the exam and shares his personal exam curriculum in another post [My Machine Learning Curriculum for May 2020: Getting TensorFlow Developer Certified](https://www.mrdbourke.com/ml-study-may-2020/)

[I just passed the TensorFlow certification...here are some tips for you, Roberto Barbero](https://medium.com/@rbarbero/tensorflow-certification-tips-d1e0385668c8) 
- Roberto's perspective on the exam is personal, fresh, and insightful. Recommended for his commentary on how to work through problems as they arrise on the exam.

## Courses
Note on courses, you want to focus on implementing and wrtiting as many models as possible with TensorFlow. The couses below were the ones I found to have the most hands on content.

1. [Udacity Intro To Tensorflow](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187)
    Good if you like structure and are starting with no knowledge. 
2. [Coursera Tensorflow Developer Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice)
    Everyone should take this course. This was my primary reference for study. :key:
3. [DataCamp Introduction to Deep Learning](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-keras)
    Good for getting started and building muscle memory with the Keras API.
4. [DataCamp Image Processing With Keras](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/image-processing-with-keras-in-python)
    Good overview of simple image models. :bulb:
5. [DataCamp Advanced Deep Learning With Keras](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/advanced-deep-learning-with-keras)
    Shows you how to use uncommon architectures in Keras. Found this highly useful for rounding out my knowledge of the Keras API. :bulb:
